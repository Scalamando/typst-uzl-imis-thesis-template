    abstract = {Despite the proliferation of research on immersive virtual reality (IVR) technologies for older adults, comprehensive guidelines on designing immersive and engaging VR for older adults remain sparse. Therefore, we first compounded 67 guidelines based on published literature. Next, to empirically ground these design recommendations, we provided 37 older adults of diverse ages, education levels, and cognitive abilities with a first VR experience. Analyzing interviews with the 37 older adults via the Laddering method, we found that they generally reported positive experiences with their first VR exposure. With these deepened insights, we reflect on, nuance, and contextualize existing design guidelines, and formulate points to bear in mind when designing accessible and engaging VR experiences for older persons.},

The Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) was developed to assist in this process by providing an objective measure of a pilot's situation awareness with any given aircraft design. SAGAT represents a substantial improvement in the current stateof-the-art for the evaluation of pilot vehicle interface designs, facilitating t h e development of cockpits which encourage high survivability in the combat environment. A formal definition of situation awareness is presented, in addition to a description of the SAGAT methodology and a discussion of its validation.},
